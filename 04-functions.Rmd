# Functions

### Dealing with NAs

As an aside, you should be aware that it is not possble to test for NA (Not Available) values in any other way; using `==` will simply return NA:

```{r}
x <- NA
x == NA
```

Dealing with NA is a **_very big thing_**. When you work with external data there is always the possibility that some values will be missing.

Other important functions for dealing with that are `na.omit()` and `complete.cases()`. Besides that, many functions in R have a (variant of) the `na.rm = ` argument.
