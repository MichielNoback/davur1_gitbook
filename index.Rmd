# Getting started

Welcome, you have landed at the eBook accompanying my R course for Life Science students, **_Data Analysis and Visualization using R (DAVuR)_**.

Before reading on, you should check whether you are ready to work with R on your own computer.
You should have installed R, RStudio and Tinytech or some other Latex alternative for your OS.

This eBook is the result of many hours of work and has been finetuned after lecturing the material for some years. 
You are free to use it in any way you like: courses and self-paced study.
